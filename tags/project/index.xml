      <title>Learning web development with Go</title>

      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to program, I&amp;rsquo;ve never focused on web development. I was more interested in old school CLI backend programs. Furthermore, PHP never attracted me so much, but was (and still is) the programming language of the web. After some time of learning Go, I realised it was used more and more for web development, as an alternative to PHP, Python, or Ruby (on Rails). After reading some articles about web programming with Go, I was thrilled: Doing web dev just felt like writing anything else in Go, no big framework necessary, just needing the fundamentals of how the websites work (and I did lack these fundamentals).</description>

      <title>Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data Streams</title>

      <description>Description
The research goal of my master thesis was to find real-time capable solutions to automatically detect anomalies in time series data streams, which are especially useful to monitor servers. I evaluated several algorithms and finally ensembled an own algorithm which meets almost all of the previously gathered requirements.
In the figure, you can see a collection of outliers, the algorithm is so good, it is even hard to see the anomaly behind all the true positives (green dots) ;-) At the beginning of the measurements, there are two false positives (red dots)</description>

      <description>Description
One of my courses during the master studies was geoinformatics. Hm, how can I describe geoinformatics with a single sentence? Without being too accurate: Everything behind services like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, and more :D
During the course, we learned all the fundamentals, for example how GPS works. Another topic is the many geographic reference systems and projections. There are so many, mainly because there isn&amp;rsquo;t a perfect solution to map a kind of a globe onto a 2-dimensional picture, thus for several use-cases, there are other approaches to deal with the distortions.</description>

      <title>Android App: Call Logger and Recorder</title>

You don&amp;rsquo;t remember what someone told you on the phone? Recording your calls made with your Android smartphone? That&amp;rsquo;s what this project was about! It was done for the course Mobile and Internet Computing. It was a really tough project because of the deadline and there is no easy way of recording calls in Android. In the end, I figured out that not all phones are capable of recording uplink and downlink.</description>

      <description>Description
It was time for my bachelor thesis and I was thinking about the topic. At this time I was totally hyped by Go (and I&amp;rsquo;m still), so I wanted to find something related. As I am always curious how things work, I wanted to research a calculator with simple algebraic operations and a web interface based on Bootstrap. Of course, this was highly inspired by all students favourite Wolfram Alpha ;-)</description>

      <description>Description
At the very beginning of my CS studies, I played a bit with Android development. You achieve the most learning when you are interested in the stuff you are doing or you have own requirements. My motivation was to write an app, which can speak out incoming notifications. As a text-to-speech engine was already built into Android (e.g. navigation directions), I thought this was a challenging but possible project.</description>
